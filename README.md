# T-chat

**T-chat** is a real-time chat application that allows users to communicate in a shared chatroom. Built as the final project for my networks class, it uses simple WebSockets to broadcast messages to all connected users. When one person sends a message, it is instantly broadcasted to everyone in the chatroom.

## Data handling
All the data is handed securely, as everything is being handled by the server.

Data is sent to a database that only the server has access to, which keeps the usernames, encrypted passwords, and routes to profile pictures of every single user that has registered.
